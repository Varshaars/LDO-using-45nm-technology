# LDO-using-45nm-technology
Title of the project is Low dropout voltage regulator using 45nm technology.
This project is done in Cadence Virtuoso.
This project focuses on the design and analysis of a Low Dropout (LDO) Voltage Regulator using 45nm CMOS technology with a 1.2V input supply. The main objective is to develop an LDO that delivers high performance with minimal power consumption, making it suitable for low power and energy constrained applications such as IoT and portable devices.
We designed Error Amplifier, Pass Transistor, Feedback Network and complete LDO Regulator.
The LDO was designed to maintain a stable output voltage under varying input voltage and load conditions.
